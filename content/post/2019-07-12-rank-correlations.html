<p>A fundamental idea in biplot methodology is the <em>conference of inertia</em>, a phrase i picked up from <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/141755/68743">an SO answer by ttnphns</a> and quickly <a href="https://github.com/corybrunson/ordr/blob/master/R/ord-conference.r">incorporated into ordr</a>. The basic idea arises from the central properties of a biplot, illustrated here for principal components analysis: A case–variable data matrix <span class="math inline">\(X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\)</span> of ratio variables<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is singular-value decomposed as <span class="math inline">\(X=UDV^\top\)</span>, for example the <code>mtcars</code> data set:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- scale(mtcars, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
s &lt;- svd(x)
r &lt;- length(s$d)</code></pre>
<p>Under this convention, <span class="math inline">\(U\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times r}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times r}\)</span> arise from eigendecompositions of <span class="math inline">\(XX^\top\)</span> and of <span class="math inline">\(X^\top X\)</span>, respectively, and <span class="math inline">\(D\in\mathbb{R}^{r\times r}\)</span> is the diagonal matrix of the square roots of their (common) eigenvalues. The matrix factors may be biplotted in three conventional ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>with <em>principal</em> case coordinates <span class="math inline">\(UD\)</span> and <em>standardized</em> variable coordinates <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>;</li>
<li>with standardized case coordinates <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and principal variable coordinates <span class="math inline">\(VD\)</span>;</li>
<li>with <em>symmetric</em> case and variable coordinates <span class="math inline">\(UD^{1/2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(VD^{1/2}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because both sets of eigenvectors <span class="math inline">\(U=\left[\,u_1\,\cdots\,u_r\,\right]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V=\left[\,v_1\,\cdots\,v_r\,\right]\)</span> are orthonormal, <span class="math inline">\(U^\top U=I_r=V^\top V\)</span> and the total inertia (variance) in each matrix is <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{j=1}^{r}{{v_j}^2}=r=\sum_{j=1}^{r}{{v_j}^2}\)</span>. Meanwhile, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> contains all of the inertia of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># inertia of the (scaled) data
sum(x^2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 341</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># inertia of the case and variable factors
sum(s$u^2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 11</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(s$v^2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 11</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># inertia of the diagonal factor
sum(s$d^2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 341</code></pre>
<p>This inertia can then be <em>conferred</em> unto the standardized case or variable coordinates, transforming one or the other into principal coordinates (the first two options above) or both halfway there (the symmetric option). Each of these options confers the inertia in such a way that the sums of the exponents of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> in the transformed sets of case (<span class="math inline">\(F=UD^p\)</span>) and variable (<span class="math inline">\(G=VD^q\)</span>) coordinates is <span class="math inline">\(p+q=1\)</span>, which ensures the <em>inner product relationship</em> <span class="math inline">\(FG^\top=X\)</span> between them. This recovers any entry <span class="math inline">\(x_{ij}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as the inner product <span class="math inline">\(f_i\cdot g_i\)</span> of its case and variable coordinates <span class="math inline">\(f_i=[\,f_{i,1}\,\cdots\,f_{i,r}\,]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_i=[\,g_{i,1}\,\cdots\,g_{i,r}\,]\)</span>.</p>
<p>By conferring the inertia entirely to the cases or variables, we preserve (or best approximate) the geometric configurations of the cases or variables, respectively. In PCA, the geometry of the cases is usually thought of in terms of the distances (dissimilarities) between them. Here their pairwise distances <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{(f_{j,1}-f_{i,1})^2+(f_{j,2}-f_{i,2})^2}\)</span> in the first two PCA dimensions are plotted against their “true” distances <span class="math inline">\(\left(\sum_{k=1}^{m}{(x_{j,k}-x_{i,k})^2}\right)^{1/2}\)</span> in the variable space:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># distances between cases
x.dist &lt;- dist(x)
# distances between cases (principal coordinates)
s.dist &lt;- dist(s$u[, 1:2] %*% diag(s$d[1:2]))
# scatterplot
plot(
  x = as.vector(x.dist), y = as.vector(s.dist),
  asp = 1, pch = 19, cex = .5,
  xlab = &quot;Case distances along variable coordinates&quot;,
  ylab = &quot;Case distances in two principal coordinates&quot;
)</code></pre>

<p>Meanwhile, the geometry of the variables is usually understood through their covariances or correlations. Writing <span class="math inline">\(X=[\,y_1\,\cdots\,y_m\,]\)</span> as an array of column variables, the covariance between <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_j\)</span> is proportional to their inner product <span class="math display">\[\textstyle \operatorname{cov}(y_i,y_j)=\frac{1}{n}y_i\cdot y_j=\frac{1}{n}\lVert y_i\rVert\lVert y_j\rVert\cos\theta_{ij}\text,\]</span> so that the cosine the angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{ij}\)</span> between them equals their correlation:
<span class="math display">\[\cos\theta_{ij}=\frac{\operatorname{cov}(y_i,y_j)}{\sqrt{\operatorname{cov}(y_i,y_i)\operatorname{cov}(y_j,y_j)}/n}=\frac{\operatorname{cov}(y_i,y_j)}{\sigma_i\sigma_j}=r_{ij}\]</span>
Here the cosines <span class="math inline">\(\frac{g_i}{\lVert g_i\rVert}\cdot\frac{g_j}{\lVert g_j\rVert}\)</span> between the variable vectors in the first two PCA dimensions are plotted against their correlations <span class="math inline">\(r_{ij}\)</span> across the original cases:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># correlations between variables
x.cor &lt;- cor(x)
# magnitudes of variable vectors
s.len &lt;- apply(s$v[, 1:2] %*% diag(s$d[1:2]), 1, norm, &quot;2&quot;)
# cosines between variables (principal coordinates)

  x = as.vector(x.cor[lower.tri(x.cor)]),

<h2>multidimensional scaling of variables</h2>
<p>The faithful approximation of inter-case distances by principal coordinates is the idea behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling">(classical)</a> <em>multidimensional scaling</em> (MDS), which can be applied to a data set of distances <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{ij},\ 1\leq i,j\leq n\)</span> in the absence of coordinates. This technique is based on the eigendecomposition of a doubly-centered matrix of squared distances, which produces matrix <span class="math inline">\(UD^{1/2}\)</span> whose first <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> coordinates—for any <span class="math inline">\(r\leq n\)</span>—recover a best approximation of the inter-case Euclidean distances in terms of the sum of squared errors, i.e. the variance of <span class="math inline">\((UD^{1/2})(UD^{1/2})^\top-\Delta=UDU^\top-\Delta\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=(\delta_{ij})\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\)</span>. In practice, the goal is usually to position points representing the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> cases in a 2-dimensional scatterplot so that their Euclidean distances <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{(x_j-x_i)^2+(y_j-y_i)^2}\)</span> approximate their original distances <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{ij}\)</span>, as in this example using road distances to approximate geographic positions:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>d &lt;- as.matrix(UScitiesD)
cent &lt;- diag(1, nrow(d)) - matrix(1/nrow(d), nrow(d), nrow(d))
d.cent &lt;- -.5 * cent %*% (d^2) %*% cent
d.mds &lt;- svd(d.cent)
d.coord &lt;- d.mds$u[, 1:2] %*% diag(sqrt(d.mds$d[1:2]))
plot(d.coord, pch = NA, asp = 1, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;)
text(d.coord, labels = rownames(d))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-12-rank-correlations_files/figure-html/multidimensional%20scaling-1.png" width="816" /></p>
<p>The faithful approximation of inter-variable covariances by the inner products of their principal-coordinate vectors suggests a complementary technique that i haven’t found explicitly discussed in my own background reading. Suppose we have data that is again coordinate-free but that consists this time not of distances between the cases but of covariances <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{cov}(y_i,y_j),\ 1\leq i,j\leq m\)</span> between the variables. Had the original data been a <em>centered</em> case–variable matrix <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, then the covariance matrix <span class="math inline">\(C=(\operatorname{cov}(y_i,y_j))\)</span> would been obtained as <span class="math inline">\(C=\frac{1}{n}X^\top X\)</span>, which is (up to scalar) the matrix whose eigenvectors would be given by <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> in the SVD <span class="math inline">\(X=UDV^\top\)</span>. Therefore, we can fabricate coordinates for the <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> variables that approximate what we know of their geometry—in this case, thinking of the variables as vectors, their magnitudes and the angles between them—via an eigendecomposition <span class="math inline">\(C=V\Lambda V^\top\)</span>: Take <span class="math inline">\(Y=V\Lambda^{1/2}\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times r}\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(Y^\top Y=C\)</span>. We can also obtain coordinates in fewer dimensions that best recover the geometry using the first eigenvectors and -values.</p>
<p>I’ll validate this line of reasoning by taking the <code>mtcars</code> data set for a spin:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># covariances and standard deviations
c &lt;- cov(mtcars)
s &lt;- diag(sqrt(diag(c)))
# centered data
x &lt;- as.matrix(scale(mtcars, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE))
# eigendecomposition of covariance matrix
c.eigen &lt;- eigen(c)
# artificial coordinates
c.coord &lt;- c.eigen$vectors %*% diag(sqrt(c.eigen$values))
# validate covariance recovery (up to sign)
all.equal(
  as.vector(c.coord %*% t(c.coord)),
  as.vector(c),
  tolerance = 1e-12
)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<p>Thus, whereas <em>MDS of cases</em> is used to represent distances, <em>MDS of variables</em> can be used to represent covariances.
The use case for this technique is a situation in which covariance data exist without variable values. This may of course be the case because original data has become unavailable; but a more interesting setting that gives rise to this situation is the analysis of multiple rankings of the same set of objects in terms of their <em>concordance</em>. Rankings’ concordance is often measured using rank correlations such as Kendall’s tau, which may be <em>general correlation coefficients</em> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_correlation#General_correlation_coefficient">the sense proposed by Kendall</a> but are not associated with an underlying (Euclidean) geometry. Nevertheless, we can use MDS to represent these rankings as unit vectors in Euclidean space whose pairwise cosines approximate their rank correlations!</p>

<h2>example: rankings of universities</h2>
<p>A real-world example is provided by the <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-world-university-rankings/methodology">Quacquarelli Symonds Top University Rankings</a>, which include rankings of hundreds of world universities on six “metrics”: academic reputation, employer reputation, faculty–student ratio, citations per faculty, international faculty ratio, and international student ratio. QS weight these rankings differently in their overall assessment, but our analysis will compare the rankings to each other, so these weights are ignored. I restricted the data from the year 2020 to universities in the United States for which integer rankings (i.e. not “400+” placeholders) were available in all four years:<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Since the integer rankings were taken from the full data set, they are not contiguous (i.e. some integers between rankings never appear). To resolve this, i’ll recalibrate the rankings by matching each vector of ranks to the vector of its sorted unique values:</p>

<p>This subset of universities is now ranked in a consistent way along the six dimensions described above. The Kendall correlation <span class="math inline">\(\kappa_{ij}\)</span> between two rankings measures their concordance. To calculate it, every pair of universities contributes either <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> according as the rankings <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> place that pair in the same order, and the sum is scaled down by the number of pairs <span class="math inline">\({n\choose 2}\)</span> so that the result lies between <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. We interpret <span class="math inline">\(\kappa_{ij}=1\)</span> as perfect concordance (the rankings are equivalent), <span class="math inline">\(\kappa_{ij}=-1\)</span> as perfect discordance (the rankings are reversed), and <span class="math inline">\(\kappa_{ij}=0\)</span> as independence (the rankings are unrelated).</p>
<p>The QS rankings are not variations on a theme, like different measures of guideline adherence or positive affect, but they do all seem potentially sensitive to a universities resources, including funding and prestige. I would intuit that the two reputational metrics should be positively correlated, and that the two international ratios should be as well. I also wonder if the faculty–student ratio might be anti-correlated with the number of citations per faculty, separating research institutions from more teaching-focused ones.</p>
<div id="correlation-heatmap" class="section level3">
<h3>correlation heatmap</h3>
<p>A common way to visualize correlation matrices is the heatmap, so i’ll use that technique first: While the rankings by academic and employer reputations are highly concordant, those by international faculty and student ratios are not less so; and, while the faculty–student ratio and faculty citation rankings are positively correlated, the relationship is the weakest of all.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>c &lt;- cor(select(qswurus20, starts_with(&quot;rk_&quot;)), method = &quot;kendall&quot;)

<p><img src="/post/2019-07-12-rank-correlations_files/figure-html/Kendall%20rank%20correlations-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This visualization is useful, but it’s very busy: To compare any pair of rankings, i have to find the cell in the grid corresponding to that pair and refer back to the color scale to assess its meaning. I can’t rely on the nearby cells for context, because they may be stronger or weaker than average and skew my interpretation. For example, the visibly weak associations between the faculty–student ratio and other rankings happen to be arranged so that the slightly stronger among them, with the two reputational variables, are sandwiched between the <em>even stronger</em> associations between the two reputational rankings and between them and the faculty citations ranking; whereas its weaker associations are sandwiched between more typical, but still comparatively stronger, associations. A different ordering of the variables might “obscure” this pattern and “reveal” others.</p>
<p>The plot is also strictly pairwise: Every correlation between two rankings occupies its own cell—two, in fact, making almost half of the plot duplicative. This means that a subset analysis of, say, three rankings requires focusing on three cells at the corners of a right triangle while ignoring all the surrounding cells. This is not an easy visual task. It would be straightforward to create a new plot for any subset, but then the larger context of the remaining rankings would be lost.</p>

<div id="correlation-biplot" class="section level3">
<h3>correlation biplot</h3>
<p>The MDS technique offers a natural alternative visualization: the biplot. As with classical MDS, the point isn’t to overlay the case scores and variable loadings from a singular value decomposition, but to use the scores or loadings alone to endow the cases or variables with a Euclidean geometry they didn’t yet have. To that end, i’ll plot the variables as vectors with tails at the origin and heads at their fabricated coordinates <span class="math inline">\(Y=V\Lambda^{1/2}\)</span>:</p>

<p>With respect to the pairwise correlations, the biplot is significantly less precise: Though the vectors all have unit length in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^r\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(r\leq m=6\)</span>), their projections onto the first two principal coordinates are clearly much shorter, indicating that much of the geometric configuration requires additional dimensions to represent. Indeed, these coordinates capture only <span class="math inline">\(48.2\%+14.3\%=62.5\%\)</span> of the inertia in the full representation. This means that the angles between the vectors must be interpreted with caution: For example, it looks like the academic and employer reputation rankings are extremely correlated, but in principle the apparent alignment of the vectors could be due to the projection, when in fact they “rise” and “fall” in opposite directions along the remaining dimensions. The correlation heatmap leaves no such ambiguity.</p>
<p>However, the biplot far surpasses the heatmap in on parsimony: Each variable is represented by a single vector, and the angles between the variable vectors roughly approximate their correlations. For instance, the rankings based on international student and faculty ratios have correlation around <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\)</span>, corresponding to either explaining half the “variance” in the other—not technically meaningful in the ranking context but a useful conceptual anchor. Meanwhile, the faculty–student ratio ranking is nearly independent of the faculty citation ranking, contrary to my intuition that these rankings would reflect a <em>reverse</em> association between research- and teaching-oriented institutions. The convenience of recognizing correlations as cosines may be worth the significant risk of error, especially when that error (the residual <span class="math inline">\(37.5\%\)</span> of inertia) can be exactly quantified.</p>
<p>Moreover, the principal coordinates of the variable vectors indicate their loadings onto the first and second principal moments of inertia—the two dimensions that capture the most variation in the data. For example, the first principal coordinate is most aligned with the two reputational rankings, suggesting that a general prestige ranking is the strongest overall component of the several specific rankings. In contrast, the faculty–student ratio and faculty citation rankings load most strongly onto the second principal coordinate, suggesting that the divide between research- and teaching-focused institutions may yet be important to understanding how universities compare along these different metrics. These observations, provisional though they are, would be difficult to discern from the heatmap. More importantly, unlike the secondary patterns visible in the heatmap, these are in no sense artifacts of the layout but arise directly from the analysis.</p>
<p>This last point means that observations made from a biplot can be validated from the MDS coordinates. In particular, we can examine the variables’ loadings onto the third principal coordinate, and we can check whether the reputational rankings are aligned or misaligned along it.</p>

<p>Based on the coordinates, the reputational rankings are aligned, as we knew already from the correlation matrix and heatmap. What’s a bit more interesting is that this component seems to separate these two rankings from those having to do with faculty citation rates and the international compositions of the faculty and student body. Based on the decomposition of inertia, this third principal coordinate is nearly as important as the second! It therefore makes sense to plot the two together:</p>

  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(add = .4)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(add = .4)) +
  ggtitle(&quot;MDS of Kendall correlations between university rankings&quot;,
          &quot;Second and third principal coordinates&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>The primary antitheses of the reputational rankings, after removing the first principal coordinate, are the rankings based on international composition, and this axis is largely independent of the axis apparently distinguishing research- from teaching-oriented institutions. From my own limited knowledge, i’d hazard a guess that this reflects two tiers of international representation among students and faculty, one expressed by the most prestigious institutions to which highly qualified students apply from all over the world, and the other expressed by institutions that are not especially prestigious but are located in communities or regions with a high percentage of international residents. This is of course no more than idle speculation on my part! But a visualization scheme that encourages hypothesis generation is worth having on hand.</p>
