<h2>who i am (here)</h2>
<p>I’m Cory Brunson<sup>he/him/his</sup>, and this is a lightweight space for me to practice expressing my outlook on matters at least peripherally professional. I completed a PhD in mathematics in 2013, and i’m now a postdoctoral fellow training myself in network analysis, data science, and health informatics. I’m an enthusiast for the extended <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> library, and i’m exploring new techniques and applications of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04019">topological data analysis</a>.</p>
<p>My under-developed <a href="https://jasoncorybrunson.netlify.com/">professional website</a> uses the highly-developed <a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic"><code>hugo-academic</code></a> theme.
You can also find me at the <a href="https://health.uconn.edu/quantitative-medicine/">Center for Quantitative Medicine</a> or at the links in the footer.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h2>what and how i blog</h2>
<p>My schedule and content may evolve, but my goal at the outset is to post fortnightly or so on, or in the vicinity of, four categories: professional development, research progress, methodological technique, and personal curiosity. I want to use this space to express ideas that are messy and incomplete; i’ll strive both to read others as charitably as reasonable and to write with the expectation that others will do the same.</p>
<p>I haven’t incorporated comments, but feel free to send me feedback via email or social media!</p>
